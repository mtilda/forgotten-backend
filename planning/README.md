### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP EXAMPLE

- User creates profile
  -- Name of user
  -- username/handle
  -- Optional profile photo
- User can create post
  -- Optional image
  -- Name of item
  -- Date lent
  -- Name of borrower
- Full CRUD available for the post
  -- Returned button
- Store user data in MongoDB deployed by Heroku
- Routes
  -- Sign up/in page

  -- User page (just user posts)
  -- Edit account page
- Deploy react app via Netlify/Surge

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Link post to the borrower's account
- Privacy settings
- Image upload - check out Qapital as a potential guide

## Components

*Note add components list

##### Time Frames

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
